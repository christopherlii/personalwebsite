# Work

I currently work at Tabs, a fintech startup that raised a $55 million Series B to build the financial singularity. What does that mean? Currently, the business largely comprises of two parts:
- Company Accounting: Companies give Tabs their contracts and billing terms, and Tabs automates the creation, sending, and follow up of invoices (money collection).
- Revenue Recognition: Tabs accurately reflects a company's financial performance according to a set standard like ASC606 by presenting how businesses "recognize" their revenue (ARR, etc). 
We simplify the jobs of every company's finance teams, and with AI, are working to automate it completely. 

This is my first full-time role after my internships, and I've quickly come to love the fast paced, chaotic nature that very much wasn't present at my time with Amazon. The entire platform team has created an environment for me to be a sponge of information. I'm insanely privileged to be the youngest employee at the company, learning from some of the most talented engineers I've ever met. If you seek to be uncomfortable everyday, this is the environment you should seek out.

# Why I'm Writing 

Recently, I've been thinking about how I want to be spending my 20s. It's difficult to identify a journey or a destination—substantially more so when one spends 10+ hours a day behind a screen. Not to say I'm not trying though: here are a couple random entries of a 300 item long list I wrote of things I want to do before I die. These "things" range from bucket lists to life-long goals.
1. Take care of a bonsai
2. Attend a World Cup Final
3. Learn to bartend
4. Found or join a startup pre-seed
5. Make a memories photobook for my partner's birthday
6. Backpack through Switzerland
7. Make bread with honey butter (Outdoor Boys!)

Fulfillment is elusive for the over-thinkers.

It's also interesting to see how my peers have changed since the start of college. High school classmates turned founders, others mastering the art of "living in the moment", and there's always someone in Japan. I've observed a gradual shift between the environment shaping the individual (bay area high school, friend groups) to the individual curating his/her own surroundings to reflect themselves (values, identity). It's not a secret that you are some reflection of traits, characteristics, and mannerisms of your five closest friends. Yet, you can't choose who you mesh well with and so most never cherry pick these five. I find it fascinating how one has full command of what they do (journey), and in extension what they achieve (destination) but almost no control over how they feel and who they are. Per Paul Graham, you can't truly want what you want. 

In my minutes of extreme, depressive deep thought, I've settled on the idea that its not really the journey or the destination, but the person you become on the journey. This idea has wide scope; it can be applied to ambition (journey=grind, destination=success, person=confidence/self-respect) or even writing (journey=consistency, destination=blog, person=writer). We can then apply this formula and work backwards from one of my goals—let's start from who a founder is. 

Most people who go on to found companies have a particular skillset that allows them to simply, when confronted with a problem, **figure it out**. I believe it's a combination of three pillars:
1. **Curiosity**: While I'm still young I want to learn as much as possible. This blog will serve as a record of how I train my curiosity, and ask as many questions as I can possibly fit into one lifetime. 
2. **Obsession**: The best win because they are obsessed with what they do. Someone without obsession lacks desire and ambition. Here's a place I can become easily-obsessive, and write about those things.
3. **Focus**: The ability to focus is one that surprisingly few people have. I've gotten decent at locking in from college exams and interviews, but I still want to tune long term focus.

Achieve these three things, and the journey/destination of that of a founder would just be consolation prizes. And that's what I want these bi-weekly volumes to be, documenting the person I want to become when all is said and done.

# Insights
- Be the dumbest one in your circle.
	- Growth is so sharp when you learn from everybody you interact with. If you're constantly the most ambitious, smartest, and hardest working in your group, you'll stagnate.
- Your understanding of yourself is different from others' perspective of you
	- Perspectives are extremely important, as they provide context around thoughts. The way you see yourself is shaped by your intentions, emotions, and internal experiences, while others only perceive your actions and words. Understanding this gap well is key to making genuine connections with others
