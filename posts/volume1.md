## Work

This was my first week working at Tabs, a fintech startup that raised a $55 million Series B to build the financial singularity. What does that mean? Currently, the business largely comprises of two parts:
- Company Accounting: Companies give Tabs their contracts and billing terms, and Tabs automates the creation, sending, and follow up of invoices (money collection).
- Revenue Recognition: Tabs accurately reflects a company's financial performance according to a set standard like ASC606 by presenting how businesses "recognize" their revenue (ARR, etc). 
We simplify the jobs of every company's finance teams, and with AI, are working to automate it completely. 

In just one week, I've quickly come to love the fast paced, chaotic nature that very much wasn't present at my time with Amazon. The entire platform team has created an environment for me to be a sponge of information. I'm insanely privileged to be the youngest employee at the company, learning from some of the most talented engineers I've ever met. If you seek to be uncomfortable everyday, join us, we're hiring! 

## Leetcode
Two of the more interesting problems I did this week
- 320. Generalized Abbreviation
	- Backtracking is so unsatisfying when you don't get it right first try. Needed to split the problem into two subproblems, THEN perform the recursive call, and then backtrack.
- 1D Candy Crush
	- Don't overcomplicate things—stacks are great :)

## Physical Training

## Fun
- I think I'll have had a friend stay over 20/31 days in October. My roommates must be annoyed.
- Highschool/intern friends swarmed into NYC for fall break—Central park, good food, and Ktown (Cho Dang Gol!!!!)
- Spent a concerning amount of time playing Catan

## Insights
- Be the dumbest one in your circle.
	- Growth is so sharp when you learn from everybody you interact with. If you're constantly the most ambitious, smartest, and hardest working in your group, you'll stagnate.
- Your understanding of yourself is different from others' perspective of you
	- Perspectives are extremely important, as they provide context around thoughts. 
	- The way you see yourself is shaped by your intentions, emotions, and internal experiences, while others only perceive your actions and words.
	- Understanding this gap well is key to making genuine connections with others
