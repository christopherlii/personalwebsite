            This is an excerpt from a final paper I wrote in freshman year, discussing works by Joan Didion, Rebecca
            Solnit, and Karl Ove Knausgaard (with references to Marcel Proust). It's here as a placeholder to test
            changes that I make, but every once in a while I'll read it back and realize I should 
            listen to my own advice more often.

               One semester in, I haven't yet fully appreciated all that NYU has to offer. I found the way 
          individuals assessed their peers to be similar to that of the reporter which berated Solnit. 
          People are confused when others think and act differently, and offended when someone questions 
          their motives. But we cannot have it both ways. By doing so, we stray from "peace, a private 
          reconciliation" (Didion) that prompts not a realization, but a subtle change of mindset. Because 
          the standard for happiness is unique to the individual, constantly trying to be better than 
          (or more similar to) others is pointless, and thinking of life as a competition becomes an obstacle 
          towards your utopia. Our lives will never be identical to the success we dream of or as horrible as 
          our worst fears, but instead something unique that cannot be unveiled through trying to be someone or 
          something else—to believe otherwise is to trap oneself in their own "prisons and punishments" (Solnit). 
          Perhaps we divert our energy and love elsewhere, and cease picturing an erroneous image of both 
          ourselves and others. Then, finally, we are alive. Our "only true voyage of discovery, the only 
          fountain of Eternal youth, would be not to visit strange lands but to possess other eyes," through
           which we can see, understand, and live (Proust).
