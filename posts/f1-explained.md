**Logistics** 

There are 24 races, each in a different city. 10 teams (for the movie they added an 11th), 2 drivers per team. Each race spans an entire weekend, and the most important sessions are the last two, called Qualifying and the Grand Prix respectively.
- In Qualifying, drivers are subject to an elimination styled competition to set their fastest one lap pace, which will determine the starting order in the race on Sunday.
- Drivers earn points based on finishing position, with the winner getting 25 points, and no points for positions below 10th.

**Things You Just Need To Know**

A car's race pace is essentially a careful negotiation between downforce (how hard the car can push itself into the ground) and drag (how to minimize air holding the car back as we cut through it). 

In the corners, you want to push your car into the ground (downforce) as much as possible for the best friction to turn. When following a car, this becomes extremely difficult as cars generate turbulent air behind them which disturbs your cars aerodynamics. Following too close to a car ahead of you for too long can ruin your race.

However, following a car becomes beneficial on the straights as the car in front of you punches a hole in the air, reducing wind resistance. This is called slipstreaming. 

Random piece of information you should also know: the temperature of tires is also important to grip and durability. Thus, drivers do a "formation" lap right before the race start in order to warm up tires, check their critical systems and gauge track conditions.

**General Strategy**

There are three tire compounds—soft, medium, hard. The softer a tire, the faster the car goes (more grip on track), but the faster it degrades. Vice versa, harder tires last longer but are slightly slower per lap. Drivers have to switch tires at least once during the race—pit stops take around 20 seconds total—but tires will degrade to the point where the trade off of those 20 seconds in the pit stop will be worth it in the long run. The timing of these stops is crucial because track position (where you are relative to other cars) is key. 

A common strategy is called the undercut. Let's say Jackson Storm is just ahead of Lightning McQueen by less than a second, and McQueen is struggling to overtake. McQueen pits first while just behind Storm. He’ll drop ~20s back but run faster laps on fresh tires, so when Storm pits later on worn tires, McQueen emerges ahead.

**How Safety Cars Work**

Incidents on track act as inflection points in race strategy as you can perform pit stops when other cars are moving slower. Minor incidents are given yellow flags, which are just cautions. If an incident is deemed severe, a safety car will lead the cars around slowly while race stewards can clear the track of any debris, car pieces, or fix any other issues.

The strategic part of all these safety efforts is that you can pit. If you make a pit stop while all the other cars are moving slower than normal, you save time relative to the other cars. A virtual safety car is similar, but instead of a real car leading the pack, all cars have to slow to a certain pace using electronic limiters. The same strategic advantage applies.

The most severe incidents are red flagged. Cars can return to the pits and change tires.

Safety cars and red flags also have big impact because they compress the field. If one car had built up a 30 second lead, which at some tracks is a third to half a lap's worth of distance, that gap disappears when a race restarts.
