# Intro

Despite not playing much this year, I can't help but notice the parallels between poker and life (more on this later). In poker, you don't show your cards until the hand is over. I'd like to start writing a quarterly letter to my friends and family for the same reason: it gives me space to reflect before sharing, like a hand played to showdown. I also owe my people an update on my progress—you've invested much time, care, and love into me, and it is because of you that I am who I am. If you're reading this, thank you for a fantastic year, and for being part of my life.

Without further ado, here's what I've been up to this fall.


# Work

I started working at Tabs, a fintech startup that raised a $55 million Series B to build the financial singularity. What does that mean? Currently, the business largely comprises of two parts:
- Company Accounting: Companies give Tabs their contracts and billing terms, and Tabs automates the creation, sending, and follow up of invoices (money collection).
- Revenue Recognition: Tabs accurately reflects a company's financial performance according to a set standard like ASC606 by presenting how businesses "recognize" their revenue (ARR, etc). 
We simplify the jobs of every company's finance teams, and with AI, are working to automate it completely. 

In my first quarter, I've quickly come to love the fast paced, chaotic nature that very much wasn't present at my time with Amazon. The entire platform team has created an environment for me to be a sponge of information. I'm insanely privileged to be the youngest employee at the company, learning from some of the most talented engineers I've ever met. If you seek to be uncomfortable everyday, join us, we're hiring!

# Why I'm Writing 

Recently, I've been thinking about how I want to be spending my 20s. It's difficult to identify a journey or a destination—substantially more so when one spends 10+ hours a day behind a screen. Not to say I'm not trying though: here are a couple random entries of a 300 item long list I wrote of things I want to do before I die. These "things" range from bucket lists to life-long goals.
1. Take care of a bonsai
2. Attend a World Cup Final
3. Learn to bartend
4. Found or join a startup pre-seed
5. Make a memories photobook for my partner's birthday
6. Backpack through Switzerland
7. Make bread with honey butter (Outdoor Boys!)

Fulfillment is elusive for the over-thinkers.

It's also interesting to see how my peers have changed since the start of college. High school classmates turned founders, others mastering the art of "living in the moment", and there's always someone in Japan. I've observed a gradual shift between the environment shaping the individual (bay area high school, friend groups) to the individual curating his/her own surroundings to reflect themselves (values, identity). It's not a secret that you are some reflection of traits, characteristics, and mannerisms of your five closest friends. Yet, you can't choose who you mesh well with and so most never cherry pick these five. I find it fascinating how one has full command of what they do (journey), and in extension what they achieve (destination) but almost no control over how they feel and who they are. Per Paul Graham, you can't truly want what you want. 

In my minutes of extreme, depressively deep thought, I've settled on the idea that its not really the journey or the destination, but the person you become on the journey. This idea is not original and has wide scope; it can be applied to ambition (journey=grind, destination=success, person=confidence/self-respect) or even writing (journey=consistency, destination=blog, person=writer). We can then apply this formula and work backwards from one of my goals—let's start from who a founder is. 

Most people who go on to found companies have a particular skillset that allows them to simply, when confronted with a problem, **figure it out**. I believe it's a combination of three pillars:
1. **Curiosity**: While I'm still young I want to learn as much as possible. This blog will serve as a record of how I train my curiosity, and ask as many questions as I can possibly fit into one lifetime. 
2. **Obsession**: The best win because they are obsessed with what they do. Someone without obsession lacks desire and ambition. Here's a place I can become easily-obsessive, and write about those things.
3. **Focus**: The ability to focus is one that surprisingly few people have. I've gotten decent at locking in from college exams and interviews, but I still want to tune long term focus.

Achieve these three things, and the journey/destination of that of a founder would just be consolation prizes. And that's what I want these quarterly letters to be, documenting the person I want to become when all is said and done.

# Fun
- I think I had a friend stay over 20/31 days in October. My roommates must be annoyed.
- Highschool/intern friends swarmed into NYC throughout the quarter—Central park, good food, and Ktown (Cho Dang Gol!!!!)
- Went to Harvard vs Yale! 
- Built an end to end autonomous ad agency at xAI's hackathon
- Spent a concerning amount of time playing Catan


# Insights
- Be the dumbest one in your circle.
	- Growth is so sharp when you learn from everybody you interact with. If you're constantly the most ambitious, smartest, and hardest working in your group, you'll stagnate.
- Your understanding of yourself is different from others' perspective of you
	- Perspectives are extremely important, as they provide context around thoughts. The way you see yourself is shaped by your intentions, emotions, and internal experiences, while others only perceive your actions and words. Understanding this gap well is key to making genuine connections with others

# Year End Reflections
I'm somewhat proud of many accomplishments in 2025. Notably, 
- Traveled without family for the first time—spicy food in Chengdu, pandas and friends in Chongqing/Shanghai, shopped in Tokyo!
- Made a group of friends during my internship that taught me the true value of [lingering](https://substack.com/@carotlyns/p-163715733). I sometimes yearn to be back in Seattle, where I and twenty-five of my fellow intern friends turned p.m. dinner plans into a.m. sidequests; the air whistling by as we scootered around Lake Union. Together, we planned retreats, Taco Tuesdays, and developed unique bonds with as many subsets of each other as we could. Nurturing this friend group convinced me that relationships are at the core of everything. 
- Spent a lot of the year optimizing—sleep, schedule, interactions, [recruiting](/#thought/how-to-recruit-for-startups). Became the first new grad hire at a Series B startup.

Unfortunately, I find it a bit tasteless to have had to measure my year in achievements. In 2025, I was much more a reactor than I was a catalyst. It often made my decisions easier—coming back to the poker analogy, I'd pick up my cards, gauge the pot, and try to play [GTO](https://upswingpoker.com/glossary/game-theory-optimal-gto/#:~:text=Game%20Theory%20Optimal%20(GTO)%20is,a%20perfect%20GTO%20strategy%20themselves.). In a world where each day represents a new hand, and there's no ante, it was extremely easy for my life to feel like autopilot. I hope to change that in 2026 through intense intentionality. 

> This is the most important lesson from poker: thinking in terms of probabilities rather than outcomes. Many systems are stochastic, not deterministic. You can do everything right and still get crushed by variance.

I've participated in an annual SIG poker tournament since freshman year, where they invite students from top colleges to compete at a shot for an interview or cash prizes. This year, instead of giving prizes to the outright winners, they shortlisted players after analyzing how they played their hands. I find this applicable in how I want to view success next year. Validating my approach to a problem not by the end outcomes but by my thought process given limited information would be closer to GTO—after all, anything in the list above could have been a lucky hand. 

I was also more risk averse than I would have liked. When something looked scary, I would fold my hand. Retrospectively, the math always favors acting over waiting. In fact, basically everything is worth trying. The only true -EV play is stagnation.

> I once won first place in my university's Poker AI competition. We had 2 hours to build a bot and first place was a new macbook. I was a freshman and had no idea what I was doing. My algorithm was literally:
>
> ```
> if isMyTurn:
>     goAllIn()
> ```
>
> I broke all the other bots, who started folding every single time
> <cite>Random Tumblr User</cite>

If my 2025 algorithm played in this competition, it'd probably have also folded too. I'm aiming to change that—still thinking in probabilities, but more willing to go for what I want. Unlike actual poker, each day you start with a new bankroll. When all is said and done, it's the unknowns that make poker (and life) exciting—a calculated bluff, shoving on a draw, playing higher stakes. 

Here's to a 2026 of going all in.
